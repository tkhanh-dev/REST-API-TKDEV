- **Categorized API Navigation**: Organized sidebar with searchable categories and endpoints
- **Real-time API Response Visualization**: View formatted JSON responses with syntax highlighting
- **Notification System**: Built-in notification center with localStorage persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Easily customizable through a `settings.json` file
- **Loading Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states for better UX
- **API Statistics**: Dashboard with endpoint counts and category metrics

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.0.0)
- Express.js for the backend server

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zen-api.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shellscript
cd zen-api
```

3. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
```

4. Modify the `settings.json` file to configure your API documentation.
5. Start the server:

```shellscript
npm start
```

Your API documentation should now be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Creating API Endpoints

Zen API makes it easy to create and document API endpoints. Each endpoint is defined as a Node.js module with metadata and a handler function.

### Example API Endpoint

Here's an example endpoint that comes with Zen API:

```javascript
const meta = {
  name: "hello",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: "A simple example API that returns a greeting message",
  author: "Your Name", 
  method: "get",
  category: "examples",
  path: "/hello?name="
};

async function onStart({ res, req }) {
  // Extract the 'name' parameter from the query string
  const { name } = req.query;

  // Default to 'World' if no name is provided
  const greeting = name ? `Hello, ${name}!` : "Hello, World!";

  // Return a simple JSON response
  return res.json({
    message: greeting,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    powered_by: "Zen API"
  });
}

module.exports = { meta, onStart };
```

Place this file in your API endpoints directory (typically `/endpoints/`), and Zen API will automatically detect and display it in the dashboard.

## Customization

You can easily customize the UI by editing the `settings.json` file. Below is a breakdown of the configurable fields:

### General Settings

- `name`: Sets the name of your API (e.g., "Zen Api").
- `version`: Specifies the version of your API interface (e.g., "Zen UI").
- `description`: A brief description of your API documentation.

### Header Customization

- `status`: Indicates the current status of your API (e.g., "Online!").
- `imageSrc`: An array of image URLs to display in the header. Multiple images can be set for variety.
- `imageSize`: Defines responsive image sizes based on the device type:
  - `mobile`: Size for mobile devices (e.g., "80%").
  - `tablet`: Size for tablets (e.g., "40%").
  - `desktop`: Size for desktops (e.g., "40%").

### Api Settings

- `creator`: Displays the creator's name in the api response. and replace the "Your Name" with your code name.

### Links

- `name`: Label for the link (e.g., "Source Code").
- `url`: The URL to the resource. replace it with your repository link.

### Notifications

You can configure notifications that will appear in the dashboard:

```json
"notifications": [
  {
    "title": "Welcome to API Dashboard",
    "message": "Explore our APIs and integrate them into your projects."
  },
  {
    "title": "New Feature",
    "message": "We've added support for WebSocket APIs. Check them out!"
  }
]
```

### Example `settings.json`

Here's an example of how your settings.json file might look:

```json
{
  "name": "Zen Api",
  "version": "Zen UI",
  "description": "Simple and Easy-to-Use API Documentation",
  "header": {
    "status": "Online!",
    "imageSrc": [
      "https://media4.giphy.com/media/l0Iy33dWjmywkCnNS/giphy.gif?cid=6c09b952p3mt40j1mgznfi9rwwtccbjl7mtc2kvfugymeinr&ep=v1_internal_gif_by_id&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g"
    ],
    "imageSize": {
      "mobile": "80%",
      "tablet": "40%",
      "desktop": "40%"
    }
  },
  "apiSettings": {
    "creator": "Your Name" 
  },
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Source Code",
      "url": "Your Name"
    },
    {
      "name": "Contact Me",
      "url": "https://t.me/ajirodesu"
    }
  ],
  "notifications": [
    {
      "title": "Welcome to API Dashboard",
      "message": "Explore our APIs and integrate them into your projects."
    },
    {
      "title": "New Feature",
      "message": "We've added support for WebSocket APIs. Check them out!"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced API Example

For more complex use cases, here's an example of an additional functionality endpoint:

```javascript
const meta = {
  name: "example",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: "A simple example API that demonstrates basic functionality",
  author: "Your Name", 
  method: "get",
  category: "examples",
  path: "/example?text="
};

async function onStart({ res, req }) {
  // Extract the 'text' parameter from the query string
  const { text } = req.query;

  if (!text) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      status: false, 
      error: 'Text parameter is required' 
    });
  }

  // Process the text (in this example, we'll just reverse it)
  const reversed = text.split('').reverse().join('');

  // Return a JSON response
  return res.json({
    original: text,
    reversed: reversed,
    length: text.length,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    powered_by: "Zen API"
  });
}

module.exports = { meta, onStart };
```
